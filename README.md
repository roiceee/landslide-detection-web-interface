# Early Landslide Prevention Monitoring System

## Overview
The Early Landslide Prevention Monitoring System is a project aimed at detecting early signs of potential landslides using sensor data collected through an Arduino-based device. This system is designed to provide real-time data via a web interface, allowing for prompt action and monitoring in landslide-prone areas.

## Features
- **Real-time Sensor Data**: Monitors and displays soil moisture, ground movement, and other relevant environmental factors.
- **Web Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use dashboard to view current conditions and historical data.
- **Alert System**: Configures thresholds for sensor readings to trigger alerts via SMS or email when potential landslide conditions are detected.
- **Data Logging**: Maintains logs of all sensor data for further analysis and pattern recognition.
